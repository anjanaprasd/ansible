# Ansible.
This Ansible playbook is designed to help you configure Logical Volume Manager (LVM) in your servers. The playbook uses loops and variables to reduce the code length and simplify the configuration process.

Before executing this playbook, make sure that you have Ansible installed on your local system and have access to the servers you want to configure.

To use this playbook, follow the steps below:

    Edit the hosts file and add the IP addresses or domain names of the servers you want to configure.

    Edit the vars/main.yml file and specify the LVM configuration details such as the volume group name, logical volume name, mount point, size, and file system type.

    Run the playbook using the command:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

    Once the playbook execution is complete, verify that the LVM is configured correctly on the servers by running the lsblk command.

Please note that this playbook is provided as a starting point and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements. It is recommended to review the Ansible documentation for more information on the available modules and options for LVM configuration.
